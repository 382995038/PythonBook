\section{\textbf{While Loops}}

A {\color{red}while loop} statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

\vspace{1cm}
The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.
